# time-feed
## What
time-feed is a tool for analysing events through placing publicly available video media on a timeline.

## How
This tool uses the Youtube and Google Maps APIs to display it's data.

## Why
Text feeds (often augmented with inforgraphics and embedded videos) have become popular when sharing news of an extended event (especially with violent crimes such as mass shootings, terrorist attacks, and similar), however it's often difficult to relate media sources and feed items together in a meaningful way.

This tool aims to change that.
